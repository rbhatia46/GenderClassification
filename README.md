# Gender Classification

The above python script uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.

## Dependencies
* Scikit-learn
* scipy

## Running the script
